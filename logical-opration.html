    <!--
      We re learning the frist one called the AND OPERATOR &&
      NOte in order of operator logical operation have a lower priority compare to math ad boolean so in he below eg the math re clavulated firstthen to the comparison then the logical operation

      the next one is OR operator(||)....it checj of atleat one side is true os if it true true or flase true or true false all the output will be true but will be false when it false false

      the enxt one is NOT Opeerator(!)
      this use one boolean value and flip it into the opposite value so for !true the output is false and for !false the output is true
    -->

    <script>
      console.log(true && true)//and operator check if two booleanvalue re both true l,e if the right and left eide re through so the output is true but if or of the side is false the and operator i]will return false
      console.log(true && false);//OUTPUT IS FALSE
      console.log(0.2 >= 0 && 0.2 < 1/3);//let assumed wwe genrate a random number and it 0.2 and we want to check if the  random number is less than 1/3 and the output here is that is true cuz 0.2 is btw 0 amd 1/3

      //the next is OR operator
      console.log(true || false); //output is true cuz one is true
      console.log(!true);// not true so it false
      console.log(!false);//not flase so it true
